# Remote Pilot Certificate

In order to fly your drone under the FAA's Small UAS Rule (Part 107), you must obtain a Remote Pilot Certificate from the FAA.

## Remote ID
Remote ID, under Part 89 in Title 14, is a digital plate license for a UAV. It is required for all UAVs that are heavier than 0.55 lbs. UAV must broadcast remote ID messages via wireless devices. When  registering your Remote ID, you have to include serial number of your UAV.

If not equipped with Remote ID, UAVs can only fly on FAA-Recognized Identification Areas (FRIA), but FRIA autorization needs to be applied for. FRIA application is only opent to community-based organizations, primary and second educational institutions, etc. The FRIA authorization will be valid for 48 months, may be renewed or terminated by FAA for safety or security reasons. 

With Standard Remote ID (not just a Remote ID broadcast module), a UAV can be operated without being limited by "visual line of sight" restriction.  

The Remote ID rule was released in April 2021 and will be effective to all pilots in Sept 16th, 2023 (30 months after the release date).

### Airspace
FAA Airspace for UAV can be found on the website: https://faa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=9c2e4406710048e19806ebf6a06754ad, or skyvector website: https://skyvector.com/

18. The UAS Facility Map, provided by FAA, displays grids with specific numbers on each grid cell. These numbers represent the maximum allowable altitude, in feet AGL, at which a UAV is allowed to fly within that specific grid cell.

19. Longitude and altitude: one degree is one hour; one small tick is one minute; large tick is 10 minutes; large black line is 30 minutes. Decimal: 3.4 degree is 3 degrees 24 min (4*6). 

20. LAANC: Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability

### Weather
METAR: Meteorological aviation routine weather reports, updated at least hourly: https://www.aviationweather.gov/metar  
METAR (1. report type) KBNA (2. station identifier) 281251Z (3. day and time zone) AUTO (4. modifier) 12008KT (5. wind) 4SM-RA HZ(6. visibility 7. weather) BKN010 OVC023 (8. sky condition) 21/17 (9. temperature) A3005 (10. Altimeter) RMK RAB25 (11. remark) 

TAF: Terminal Area Forecasts; local forecasts for 5 nm (nautical miles) sorrounding on airport; reported from large airports; valid for 24 or 30 hours; updated 4 times a day;  
TEMPO: temporary;  
FM: from;  
PROB30: probability of 30%. 

KFTW (location) 281720Z (time) 2818/2924 (valid for 28 hours to 18 hours; valid until 29th midnight) 28004KT (wind) P6SM (visibility) VCSH (shower in the vicinity) SCT025 (scattered at 2500 ft) OVC040 (overcast at 4000 ft)

In practice, we should use weather apps. 

1. TETAR: routine report; SPECI: special report.

2. station identifier  

3. date and time: DDHHMMZ; Z for zulu time, which is 5 hours behind Eastern Standard time; 

4. modifier

5. wind: DDDSSKT; three digits for coming direction; following two digits for speed in Knots; G for gusting up to a speed. 

6. visibility: SM: statute mile; R for runway visibility

7. weather:  
"-" light;  
"+" heavy;  
VC in the vicinity;  
BL blowing;  
SH Showers;  
TS Thunderstorms;  
FZ Freezing;  
DZ Drizzle;  
RA Rain;  
SN Snow;  
BR Mist;  
FG Fog.  

8. sky condition:  
VV vertical visibility;  
SKC or CLR clear;  
FEW few;  
SCT scattered;  
BKN broken;       
OVC overcast.  

BKN layers are considered a ceiling because they cover more than 1/2 of the sky.

9. temperature: temperature/dew point in Celsius. 

10. Altimeter

11. Remarks

12. Standard pressure: 29.92 inHg; standard temperature: 15 C. 

13. Altitude: AGL (above ground level); MSL (mean sea level); Density altitude: high density altitude is bad for aviation; density altitude is affected by pressure, temperature, and humidity. High humidity is bad for aviation, because water vapor is sparser than air. 

14. Atmospheric stability (vertical air movement): depends on temperature and moisture in the air;  
stable atmosphere: poor visibility; steady precipitation; stratiform(stratus) clouds; minimum verticle air movement;
unstable atmosphere: good visibility; showery percipitation (thunderstorms); cumuliform (cumulous) clouds; a lot of verticle air movement; 

15. Thunderstorm  
Cumulous stage: uplifting  
Mature stage (comulonimbus): uplifting and downdraft (most dangerous situation for aviation)  
Dissipating stage: uplifting is gone and only downdraft (downdraft overpowers updrafts) 

16. Temperature inversions: air gets warmer when altitude increase, which reduces visibility because the cooler air below is trapped.   

17. Fog: forms when temperature and dew points are very close. Dew point is the temperature at which air becomes saturated with moisture and can no longer hold all of its water vapor.  
Radiation: warm air is cooled by cool ground  
Advection: warm air is cooled by cool water   
Upslope: warm air is cooled by high altitude slope    
Evaporation: evaporated warm air is cooled by cool air

Hazardous Attitudes:  
1. Anti-authority: "Don't tell me what to do" - "Follow the rules"  
2. Impulsivity: "Do something quickly" - "Not so fast"  
3. Invulenrability: "It won't happen to me" - "It could happen to me"    
4. Macho: "I can do it" - "Taking chances is foolish"  
5. Resignation: "What's the use?" - "I am not helpless"  

### Aicraft Loading and Performance 
1. Weight and balance information will be in the Pilot's Operating Handbook or UAS manual.

2. After CG has better aircraft performance. 

3. Forward CG is easier to recover from a stall. 

4. Four basic forces: thrust, lift, drag, weight.

5. Critical angle of attack: stall.

6. Stability:  
positive: converging  
neutral:   
negative: diverging 

7. Load factor increase at anytime a force is applied to an aircraft to deflect its flight from a straight line. 


### Aeromedical Factors & Emergency procedures
1. Hyperventilation: excessive rate of breathing that cause CO2 decrease and O2 increase, resulting in unconsciousness. 

2. Blood alcohol concentration (BAC): less than 0.04 percent. 

3. No flight within 8 hours of having alcohol or in hangover.

4. An in-flight emergency is an unexpected and unforeseen serious situtation that requires urgent action. In case of an in-flight emergency, the RPIC is permitted to deviate from any rule of part 107. In this case, no report is needed less you are requested to do so. 

5. RPIC should program the lost link route to avoid flying over people. It is best to avoid flying over people all the times. 

### Airport Operation & Radio Communications 
1. Blue airports: controlled airport; ATC communication; minitored traffic;

2. Magenta airport: uncontrolled airport; no direct ATC communication; CTAF or UNICOM (1-to-1) communication

3. ATC: air traffic control.

4. Five parts of airport: Upwind; crosswind; downwind (40 degree to entire); base; final (touchdonw).

5. Heading: clockwise direction in 10 degree. 

6. Heliport: Magenta circle with H inside.

7. Seaport: Magenta circle with anchor symbol. 

8. Sectional map and chart supplement: airport information. e.g., https://skyvector.com/ 

9. NOTAMs: Notice and time-sensitive information. 

10. ATIS, ASOS and AWOS frequencies: weather.

11. Airport on sectional map: CT (control tower frequency); ATIS (weather requency); elevation; L (longest runway in hundred ft); CTAF (with C in the end) or UNICOM (without letter in the end) frequency

12. Most airports are left-turn (counter clock wise).

13. tower: MSL (AGL).

14. Bird strikes: report to National Wildlife Strike Database. 

15. chart supplement: the most information about an airport. 

16. The FAA recommends systematically focus on different segments of the sky for short intervals as it is the most thorough and methodical technique.

17. ATC: (1) who you are talking to, (2) who you are, (3) where you are, (3) what you want. (who who where what)

### Maintenance & Preflight Procedures
1. Maintenance should be done by the manufacturer or professional technician.
